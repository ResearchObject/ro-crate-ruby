# Galaxy mini workflow

A tiny Galaxy workflow that sorts tabular lines according to the first column
and changes the text to upper case.

This RO-Crate is based on an [example from the Life Monitor repository](https://github.com/crs4/life_monitor/tree/8437be177822d0e2b3fed30db094b91c2fc14391/interaction_experiments/data/crates/ro-crate-galaxy-sortchangecase).
